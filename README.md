AI Mental Health Tracker: Empowering Well-being with Python!

Dataset Overview:
Our code relies on a comprehensive CSV dataset, encompassing a range of mental health indicators. With variables like stress levels, sleep patterns, and daily activities, we have a treasure trove of data to fuel our predictive models.

Data Preprocessing:
To ensure accurate predictions, our code starts by performing essential data preprocessing tasks. We handle missing values, normalize the data, and transform variables to their appropriate formats. By meticulously preparing the dataset, we set the stage for robust analysis.

Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression:
Our Python code harnesses the power of linear regression and random forest regression models to predict mental health outcomes. By training these models on the dataset, we can gain insights into the factors influencing well-being and make accurate predictions.

Interactive Insights:
With our interactive python code, you can explore the data hands-on. Visualize trends, uncover correlations between mental health indicators, and even experiment with different model parameters to understand their impact on predictions. It's a unique opportunity to deepen your understanding of mental well-being.

Empowering Well-being:
By utilizing this code for AI Mental Health Tracking, we can empower individuals, therapists, and healthcare providers alike. The insights gained from accurate predictions enable personalized interventions, proactive mental health care, and improved overall well-being.

Embrace the Power of AI:
The convergence of artificial intelligence and mental health is a game-changer. With the code, you can tap into the potential of data-driven analysis and revolutionize mental health monitoring. Seamlessly merge technology and well-being for a brighter future.
